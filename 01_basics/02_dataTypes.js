/* ECMAScript (ES)

ECMAScript (ES) is the official standard on which JavaScript is based.

Think of it like this:

ECMAScript = the rulebook (specification).

JavaScript = the actual language you use in browsers, based on that rulebook.

Example:

ES5, ES6, ES7 ‚Ä¶ are different versions of ECMAScript.

ES6 (released in 2015) introduced many new features in JavaScript, like:

let and const


So whenever you hear ES6, ES7, ES2022, that‚Äôs just the ECMAScript version being referred to.

üìö MDN (Mozilla Developer Network)

MDN Web Docs is a documentation website created by Mozilla.

It‚Äôs the most trusted source for web technologies (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, APIs, etc.).

Developers use it to learn how JavaScript functions, objects, and methods work, with examples and explanations.
